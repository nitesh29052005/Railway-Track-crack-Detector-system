# Railway-Track-crack-Detector-system
Railway Track Crack Detector System uses IR sensors and Arduino to detect cracks on railway tracks in real time. When a fault is found, the system triggers a buzzer and shows alerts on LCD. This helps reduce accidents, improves safety, and can be enhanced with GPS or wireless modules for future development.
